    <div class="bodyParagraph">
        Seriously, that's it. Well, <i>just</i> about it. There's a bit of CSS in here for styling, sure; but this page represents
        how simple the web <i>used</i> to be. There's no fancy framework at play here, no Javascript, no Typescript; just 
        good ole HTML and CSS.
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodyParagraph">
        You know what else is here? Text. <i>Plain old text.</i> In this day and age, I think we sometimes (especially as developers)
        forget what the web was really created for. To spread ideas, information, and thoughts across distances that used to seem unfathomable.
        Not to be the most visually extravagant or interactive website since Facebook, but as a medium for passing passing information.
    </div>

    <div class="bodyParagraph">
        Shrink me, I dare you. Hell, <i>open me on your phone</i> for all I care. Notice anything? I'm still here. I'm still left-aligned; I still
        have my margins. See that title? It's still centered on your device, I know. I still look -- dare I say -- <i>good.</i> When things were this simple,
        we didn't need to write media queries; we didn't need to account for a myriad of resolutions interacting with our JS components. All we 
        really cared about was spreading the information you're seeing here, on this page.

    <div class="bodyParagraph">
        Any one of you reading this could have made this 'website'. Seriously. If you're at all familiar with HTML and CSS, you may only need a few minutes. 
        Hell, the speed at which you can recreate this exact website will likely be limited by how quickly you can type (or maybe by how picky you are about
        wording, if you don't like mine). All this to say: web development has certainly gotten more complex as the web has aged. If you feel like you're drowning
        in complexity, if you're dreading the idea of making your web-app responsive, or you're tired of learning yet another what feels like over-the-top web
        framework, I implore you: just create some HTML. Pepper in a little CSS. In a few minutes you'll be able to convey <i>so much</i> information. This is how 
        it the web started, after all. <i>You</i> can do this. And if you did?
    </div>

    <div class="bodyParagraph">
        Revel in what you've created. Look at all that information there, neatly organized on the DOM, responsive as can be. You can convey <i>exactly</i> what you want.
        You know how to get started. It doesn't take any fancy bells or whistles, any extensive outside libraries. All it takes is you, your trusty keyboard, and some
        HTML & CSS.
